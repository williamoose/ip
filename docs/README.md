# Jobe User Guide


![Product Screenshot](Ui.png)


Jobe is a desktop app for managing your tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Jobe can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.


# Quick start
1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed in your Computer.
   __Mac users:__ Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed here.

2. Download the latest .jar file.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Jobe.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the java -jar jobe.jar command to run the application.  
   A GUI similar to the screenshot above should appear in a few seconds.

# Saving and Loading Data

A data file is automatically created upon typing your first command. There is no need to create one manually.  
Similarly, after every command, the new/modified tasks are automatically saved to this data file.

Advanced users are welcome to edit this data file. 

Note: Do not move the data file to any other location as Jobe searches the exact file path to load your tasks.
